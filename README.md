# Predictive Travel Model Using SkyScanner API and R

## Mission

The purpose of this project was to leverage the SkyScanner API to tackle a complex problem: helping a group of friends with diverse interests choose the best travel destination. Each friend had different preferences, and our goal was to develop a predictive model that could assess the likelihood of each person deciding to go on a proposed trip, based on various characteristics of that destination.

All code was written primarily in R using RStudio IDE, with a few auxiliary blocks in Python when needed. The primary file format used throughout the project was R Markdown (.Rmd), which allowed us to combine code, documentation, and analysis in a single environment.

## Accessing the SkyScanner API

Hereâ€™s an example of how we queried the SkyScanner API to retrieve flight and airport data in a structured dataframe format:

```r
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)
library(dplyr)

api_key <- "sh96749013922489669243964410****"

obtener_vuelos <- function(origen, destino, fecha_salida, fecha_regreso = NULL, pais = "ES", moneda = "EUR", idioma = "es-ES") {
  url <- paste0("https://skyscanner-skyscanner-flight-search-v1.p.rapidapi.com/apiservices/browsequotes/v1.0/",
                pais, "/", moneda, "/", idioma, "/", origen, "/", destino, "/", fecha_salida)

  if (!is.null(fecha_regreso)) {
    url <- paste0(url, "/", fecha_regreso)
  }

  res <- GET(url, add_headers(
    "X-RapidAPI-Key" = api_key,
    "X-RapidAPI-Host" = "skyscanner-skyscanner-flight-search-v1.p.rapidapi.com"
  ))

  if (status_code(res) != 200) {
    warning(paste("Request failed with status:", status_code(res)))
    return(NULL)
  }

  json_data <- fromJSON(content(res, as = "text", encoding = "UTF-8"), flatten = TRUE)

  if (length(json_data$Quotes) == 0) {
    message("No results found.")
    return(NULL)
  }

  vuelos <- lapply(json_data$Quotes, function(q) {
    carrier_id <- q$OutboundLeg$CarrierIds[1]
    carrier_name <- json_data$Carriers$Name[json_data$Carriers$CarrierId == carrier_id]
    origin_id <- q$OutboundLeg$OriginId
    destination_id <- q$OutboundLeg$DestinationId
    origin_name <- json_data$Places$Name[json_data$Places$PlaceId == origin_id]
    destination_name <- json_data$Places$Name[json_data$Places$PlaceId == destination_id]

    data.frame(
      Price = q$MinPrice,
      Direct = q$Direct,
      Airline = ifelse(length(carrier_name) > 0, carrier_name, NA),
      Origin = ifelse(length(origin_name) > 0, origin_name, NA),
      Destination = ifelse(length(destination_name) > 0, destination_name, NA),
      DepartureDate = q$OutboundLeg$DepartureDate,
      stringsAsFactors = FALSE
    )
  })

  return(bind_rows(vuelos))
}
```



## Data Processing & Logistic Regression Modeling
After retrieving and cleaning the flight data (around 400 observations), we tailored the dataset to train a logistic regression model (logit model) to predict travel decisions.

## Final Dataset
We exported our dataset to a .csv file and used it as input to define our model variables.

## Data Description
The dataset contains information on travel decisions made by several users. The binary response variable admit is:

0: the user decides not to go on the trip

1: the user does go

We modeled the probability of a user accepting the trip based on the following variables:

per: Number of travel companions

mood: Peacefulness of the destination (scale 0â€“10)

dis: Distance to the destination (in kilometers)

din: Estimated cost (in EUR)

idi: Language spoken at the destination (0 = native, 1 = foreign)

temp: Climate factor (0â€“10)

## Model Summary
The logistic model produced reliable results, with statistically significant coefficients (p-values) for most variables.

## Making Predictions
With the trained model, we could predict whether a new user would decide to go on a trip based on a set of destination attributes.

## Prediction Accuracy:
Our model achieved a prediction accuracy of 80.5%, indicating solid generalization performance.

## Developing the User Interface with Shiny
To make our model accessible and interactive, we created a graphical user interface using the Shiny library in R.

```r

library(shiny)
library(shinythemes)
library(bslib)

mi_tema <- bs_theme(
  version = 5,
  bootswatch = "minty",
  primary = "blue",
  secondary = "blue",
  base_font = font_google("Roboto"),
  heading_font = font_google("Roboto")
)

ui <- fluidPage(
  tags$head(tags$title("Travel Prediction")),
  tags$img(src = "logo.png", height = "150px", style = "display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"),

  theme = mi_tema,
  div(
    h1("SkyScanner Logit Predictive Model: Will You Travel?", 
       style = "text-align: center; font-weight: bold; color: black;")
  ),
  br(),
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
      h4("Enter trip details:"),
      sliderInput("per", "Number of companions:", min = 0, max = 10, value = 3),
      sliderInput("mood", "Peacefulness of the destination:", min = 0, max = 10, value = 6),
      sliderInput("dis", "Distance (km):", min = 0, max = 5000, value = 1000, step = 100),
      sliderInput("din", "Estimated Cost (EUR):", min = 0, max = 5000, value = 600, step = 50),
      selectInput("nativo_extranjero", "Language spoken:", choices = c("Native" = 0, "Foreign" = 1)),
      sliderInput("preferencia_clima", "Climate Preference (0â€“10):", min = 0, max = 10, value = 7),
      br(),
      actionButton("predecir", "Predict", class = "btn btn-success btn-lg")
    ),
    mainPanel(
      br(),
      h3("Prediction Result:"),
      br(),
      wellPanel(
        style = "background-color: #A1EBD1; border-left: 5px solid: #A1EBD1",
        uiOutput("resultado")
      )
    )
  )
)

server <- function(input, output) {
  observeEvent(input$predecir, {
    x.new <- data.frame(
      per = input$per,
      mood = input$mood,
      dis = input$dis,
      din = input$din,
      nativo_extranjero = as.numeric(input$nativo_extranjero),
      preferencia_clima = input$preferencia_clima
    )

    prob <- predict(modelo.logit, x.new, type = "response")

    mensaje <- sprintf("The probability that the user will travel is %.1f%%.\n", prob * 100)

    if (prob >= 0.5) {
      mensaje <- paste0(mensaje, "Prediction: YES, the user will travel.")
    } else {
      mensaje <- paste0(mensaje, "Prediction: NO, the user will not travel.")
    }

    output$resultado <- renderUI({ 
      tags$div(style = "color: white; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6;", mensaje)
    })
  })
}

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)

```

Finally, we created an app using real data flights price with the amadeus API. The app consists in an user request with this parameters: number of people, budget, dates, departure and the preference of a climate. We take some possibles places and we analyze it with this parameters. The app sends the top 3 destinations to the user using the stadistic journey app.

# Trip Destination Recommender

A desktop application that helps you find the top 3 travel destinations from your departure city, based on your budget, travel dates, distance preferences and climate tastes. Under the hood it uses:

- The **Amadeus API** to discover nearby airports and flight offers  
- **OpenWeatherMap** to classify current climate in each destination  
- A **logistic regression** predictive model (trained on `viajes.csv`) to score each option by affinity

## Final Packaging & App Deployment
To make the application easily executable on any computer we installed a portable version of R to avoid dependency issues and organized the app directory into a distributable format.
We then used Inno Setup Compiler to generate a Windows installer for the final product.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to integrate external data via APIs and perform predictive modeling using logistic regression, but also how to deploy a full-fledged interactive application. The result: a functional tool that can assist users in making personalized travel decisions based on their preferences.
